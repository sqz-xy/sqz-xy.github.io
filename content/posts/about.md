# Hello There!

My name is Tom or sQzxY and I am a programmer currently studying Computer Science at the University of Hull.

This site will be here to showcase my portfolio of projects along with any other relavent artefacts.

My Favourite language is C# although Javascript is growing on me fast!

Here are some ways to find/contact me:

- here is my [**GitHub**](https://github.com/sqz-xy).
- here is my [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/_sqzxy).

Thank you for coming along
